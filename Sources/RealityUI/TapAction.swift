/// ``TapActionComponent`` is a component that allows entities to respond
/// to tap actions in the RealityKit environment.
///
/// When an entity is associated with a ``TapActionComponent``, it indicates
/// that the entity should trigger an action when tapped.
/// There is also requirement for the entity to have a `CollisionComponent`.
///
/// The action is a closure that provides both the tapped entity and
/// the world position (if available) of the point where the entity was tapped.
///
/// > The world position might be `nil` if the exact point of collision cannot be determined.
///
/// Example usage:
/// ```swift
/// let entity: Entity = ...
/// entity.components[TapActionComponent.self] = TapActionComponent { tappedEntity, worldPosition in
///     print("Entity \(tappedEntity) was tapped at \(worldPosition ?? .zero)!")
/// }
/// ```

    ///   - SIMD3<Float>?: The world position where the entity was tapped, or `nil` if not available.
