# RealityUI

RealityUI is a collection of User Interface classes for RealityKit.
The classes included in RealityUI aim to offer familiar User Interface guidelines, but in a 3D setting for Augmented and Virtual Reality through RealityKit.

The User Interface controls in this repository so far are made to be familiar to what people are used to with 2D interfaces, however the plan is to expand the tools on offer to new and unique controls, which are more appropriate for an Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality context.

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

Add the URL of this repository to your Xcode 11+ Project under `Project > Swift Packages`.

`https://github.com/maxxfrazer/RealityUI.git`

## Usage

Add `import RealityUI` to the top of your swift file to start.

#### Registering RealityUI Components

All components used in RealityUI must be registered before they are used, simply call `RealityUI.registerComponents()` anywhere in your app before any classes starting with `RUI` are initialised to avoid issues with that. For more information on what is meant by registering components [see Apple's documentation here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit/component/3243766-registercomponent).

#### Activating Gestures

Enabling RealityUI gestures can be doen by calling `RealityUI.enableGestures(.all, on: ARView)`, with `ARView` being your instance of an [ARView](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit/arview) object.

RUISlider, RUISwitch, RUIStepper and RUIButton all use `.longTouch`, and if you are adding elements that use the component `TapActionComponent` you can use the gesture `.tap`.
I would just recommend using `.all` when enabling gestures, as these will inevitably move around as RealityUI develops.

`RealityUI.enableGestures(.all, on: arView)`

## Control Entities

By default all RealityUI Entities are quite large. This is used to standardize the sizes so that you always know what to expect. For example, all UI thumbs are spheres with a diameter of 1 meter, which is 1 unit in RealityKit, Â± any padding adjustments. All RealityUI Entities face `[0, 0, -1]` by default. To have them point at the user camera, or `.zero`, you can use the [`.look(at:,from:,relativeTo:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit/entity/3244094-look) method like so: `.look(at: .zero, from: [0, 0, 1])`. Or if you want it to turn around straight away if you've positioned it at `[0, 0, -1]`, set the orientation to `simd_quatf(angle: .pi, axis: [0, 1, 0])`. Using the [.look()](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit/entity/3244094-look) method works here by setting the `at:` value to the direction the button should be used from.

### RUISwitch

RUISwitch is a 3D toggle switch with an on and off state.
Default bounding box is 2x1x1m

![RUISwitches with and without light responsiveness](https://github.com/maxxfrazer/RealityUI/blob/main/media/switches_combined.gif?raw=true)

[More details](https://github.com/maxxfrazer/RealityUI/wiki/Control-Entities#ruiswitch)

### RUIStepper

RUIStepper is used to increment or decrement a value.
Default bounding box is 2x1x0.25m

[More details](https://github.com/maxxfrazer/RealityUI/wiki/Control-Entities#ruistepper)

### RUISlider

An interactive track to represent an interpolated value.
Default bounding box is 10x1x1m including thumb.

[More details](https://github.com/maxxfrazer/RealityUI/wiki/Control-Entities#ruislider)

### RUIButton

RUIButton is used to initiate a specified action. The action here will only trigger if the gesture begins on a button, and also ends on the same button. This is similar to the [touchUpInside UIControl Event](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uicontrol/event/1618236-touchupinside).
Default button bounding box before depressing the button into the base is `[1, 1, 0.3]`

## Gestures

All of the RealityUI Control Entities use custom gestures that aren't standard in RealityKit, but some of them have been isolated so anyone can use them to manipulate their own RealityKit scene.

### Turn

Unlock the ability to rotate a RealityKit entity with just one finger.

![Turning key](https://github.com/maxxfrazer/RealityUI/raw/e3cb908fa9051512671e01dd3fe01f59c45f0936/media/RealityUI_pivot_key.gif?raw=true)

[More details](https://github.com/maxxfrazer/RealityUI/wiki/Gestures#turn)

### Tap

Create an object in your RealityKit scene with an action, and it will automatically be picked up whenever the user taps on it!

No Gif for this one, but check out [RealityUI Gestures wiki](https://github.com/maxxfrazer/RealityUI/wiki/Gestures#tap) to see how to add [TapActionComponent](https://maxxfrazer.github.io/RealityUI/documentation/realityui/TapActionComponent.html) to an entity in your application.

---
## Animations

There aren't many animations added by default to RealityKit, especially none that you can set to repeat. See the [wiki page](https://github.com/maxxfrazer/RealityUI/wiki/Animations) on how to use these animations.

### Spin
Spin an Entity around an axis easily using ruiSpin.

### Shake

Shake an entity to attract attention, or signal something was incorrect.

## Text

It's already possible to place text in RealityKit, but I felt it needed a little upgrade.

With RUIText you can easily create an Entity with the specified text placed with its bounding box centre at the middle of your entity.

![Hello Text](https://github.com/maxxfrazer/RealityUI/blob/main/media/RUIText_hello_example.gif?raw=true)
